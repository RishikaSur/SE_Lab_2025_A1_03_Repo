# 📂 Collaborative Project: Inventory, Marks, and Task Management Systems

Welcome to the collaborative repository for three different systems designed to manage various tasks and processes. This repository contains three systems that have been developed as part of an academic assignment. Each system will be handled by a different student, and version control will be used throughout the development.

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository consists of three systems:
1. **Inventory Management System**: A store management system that allows customers to make purchases, and sellers to update product details. The system will track purchases and maintain a history of product transactions.
2. **Marks Management System**: A system that tracks student marks across different subjects. Teachers can edit their assigned subjects, and the final scores will be displayed in an organized manner.
3. **Task Management CLI Tool**: A simple command-line application for managing tasks. It allows users to add, edit, and complete tasks, while also tracking changes using version control.

Each student will work on a specific task, and **Git** will be used to maintain version control throughout the project. The development will be divided so that each student focuses on one system.

**Features**:
- ➕ Users can add new tasks to the system.
- ✏️ Tasks can be edited or marked as completed.
- 🔄 The system will keep a history of task changes, and each change will be tracked using Git.
